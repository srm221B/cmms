# Railway Setup Guide

## ðŸš¨ Current Issue
Railway is showing its default page instead of your CMMS application. This means Railway isn't connected to your repository properly.

## ðŸ”§ Solution Steps

### Option 1: Fix Current Railway Project

1. **Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)**
2. **Find your CMMS project**
3. **Go to Settings tab**
4. **Verify GitHub repository is: `https://github.com/srm221B/cmms.git`**
5. **If not connected, click "Connect Repository"**
6. **Select your `cmms` repository**
7. **Go to Deployments tab**
8. **Click "Redeploy"**

### Option 2: Create New Railway Project

1. **Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)**
2. **Click "New Project"**
3. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Choose your `cmms` repository**
5. **Railway will automatically detect it's a Python project**
6. **Set environment variables if needed**
7. **Deploy**

### Option 3: Manual Railway CLI Setup

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

After fixing the Railway connection, you should see:

- **`https://cmms.railway.app/`** â†’ Beautiful CMMS interface (like your local server)
- **`https://cmms.railway.app/api`** â†’ API root
- **`https://cmms.railway.app/health`** â†’ Health check
- **`https://cmms.railway.app/test-railway`** â†’ Test endpoint

## ðŸš¨ If Still Not Working

1. **Check Railway deployment logs** for errors
2. **Verify the repository branch is `main`**
3. **Make sure Railway has access to your GitHub repository**
4. **Try creating a completely new Railway project**

## ðŸ“ž Support

If Railway still shows the default page after following these steps, the issue is with Railway's project configuration, not your code (since your local server works perfectly).
